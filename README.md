# Practicing Git
Inspired from [git-sandbox](https://github.com/AGV-IIT-KGP/git-sandbox).

This is a place to practice git. Your first exercise is to add your name to this list.
To complete this exercise you need to:

- **Learn to use git**:
  - Go through the try git tutorial at https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1
  - Read the book [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
  - Git and Github tutorial videos [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/GitHubGuides)

  You can also go through the [curated list of git
resource](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/) provided by github to find other resouces to fit your need.  

- **Fork the repo, clone the forked repo, create a new branch, make changes and send a pull request**
  - [This article](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) should give you a good idea of what pull requests are how to use them.
  - A step by step guide can be found [here](https://github.com/asmeurer/git-workflow)

Your entry should maintain **alphabetic order** and it should be in the format:

`* your name [username](http://github.com/username)`. 

This file is written in the [Markdown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Lines starting with `*` are automatically rendered as bullet points and phrases containing `[name](URL)` are automatically hyperlinked.
